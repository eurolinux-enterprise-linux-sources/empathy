Empathy is a client built on the Telepathy messaging framework. However, 
without a proper backend (connection manager) installed, it is essentially
useless.

XMPP, as a standardized and unencumbered protocol, is supported through the
telepathy-gabble (Jabber and GoogleTalk) and telepathy-salut (link-local)
connection managers.

MSN support is now handled by telepathy-gabble. Refer to:
http://blogs.gnome.org/xclaesse/2011/11/03/msn-in-empathy-with-xmpp/

Support for AIM/ICQ, Gadu-Gadu, Groupwise, QQ, and Yahoo! are all provided
by telepathy-haze.

If you think the Empathy package should require additional connection managers,
please report on bugzilla.redhat.com.
